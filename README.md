# SMS-text-compression
This project compresses SMS text using a three-stage pipeline: lossy abbreviation and vowel removal, Burrows-Wheeler Transform for rearranging text, and Modified Run-Length Encoding for final compression. It reduces message size for low-bandwidth systems like SMS, IoT, and emergency communication.
